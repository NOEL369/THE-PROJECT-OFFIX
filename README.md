# THE--PROJECT-OFFIX

As technology advances, robots have become an increasingly important part of our daily life. Robots have been developed and constructed for a variety of activities that are risky, time-consuming, or difficult for people to complete. The development of autonomous office assistance robots has changed the business sector by drastically decreasing the workload of office staff. An advanced robot created to collaborate with people in an office setting is an autonomous office assistive robot. These robots are programmed to carry out a variety of duties, such as transferring documents and refreshments from one employee to another, minimizing the workload of office workers. These robots are able to navigate around the office independently and perform given jobs without assistance from individuals as they're equipped with various sensors. 

Office assistance robots are capable of interacting with office workers in addition to doing physical tasks. They can provide directions, respond to commonly requested questions, and even remind workers of important schedules. These robots can successfully interact with staff members, greatly simplifying their workdays.
